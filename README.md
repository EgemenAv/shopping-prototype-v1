  # Shopping Cart

  Simple shopping app demo.
  
  ## Description

  First iteration of a shopping app where I only utilized front-end development. 
  The landing page is a shopping page where the user can add displayed items to their cart. Cart icon on the top right shows the number of items the user currently has in their cart. The user can click on the icon to see an overview of their shopping cart on a sidebar. Through the overview sidebar, the user can change the quantity of each item, clear the cart, or proceed to the cart page. Similar functionalities are present on the cart page as well.
